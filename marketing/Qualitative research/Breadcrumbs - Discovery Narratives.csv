sites are supported2.Extension is slow to track websites, doesn't
pick up everything - I assume this can be fixed over time3.Not clear what the value proposition is. If
it's just to track everything for later shopping, I imagine:a.More attractive for people who really like to
browse stuff (I am one), perhaps primarily women?b.So for this high-volume browser, and I know
you prefer automatic rather than bookmarking / Pinterest pins, but as someone
browses more and more, I could have hundreds, if not thousands of items saved
over a few months. Is there still a lot of value in this with so many items?
Can you remember how to filter it? Or do you just give up and go to Google or
go back to using manual methods (defeating the purpose of automatic)c.Ha mentioned about tracking prices with the
things you see, but I think tracking everything is not what people want - how
often do you look at your chrome history for example? In theory it sounds good,
but at a certain volume, it becomes too much.d.If this is about gathering data and showing
insights (showing what people like you are buying, or also looking at so you
have a sense what could be popular), that could be useful assuming people are
ok with the data crunching.e.If you will track everything automatically,
you need to track it for every single shopping site. If I get used to it
recording everything that I could buy, I expect it to work everywhere. I don't
want to be on a random site and then learn weeks later, those items aren't in
the history. At that point, I lose trust, and go back to manual methods.","Prospect: heavy online shopper, his only concern is about us not being able to collect all his activity (which would require covering every single site), and his dashboard becoming too cluttered.

shopping across more sites. Amazon is certainly valuable since I usually check
there to price compare for pretty much everything, but for instance this
morning I was looking at things also on Zappos and Patagonia and would have
loved to track those items as well.I really love the breadcrumbs interface compared to any other
""wish list"" type functionality I've ever see on a website. Would LOVE
to be able to easily go back to things I looked at. (Also could see it being
helpful for my husband if he wanted to scope out stuff to get me for a
birthday/holiday gift – like if you could choose to give someone access to your
breadcrumbs). My use case right now that is well served by breadcrumbs: I'm
visiting India for a month and want to buy a few things like sandals and
lightweight pants etc. for my travels and have been shopping for a few minutes
at a time when I have a break here and there – breadcrumb is an awesome easy
way to track the items of interest without having to add them all to a
wishlist, or (what I often do) leave browser windows open for ages until I can
come back to review them.Only negative so far (besides the very limited shopping sites
covered) is that the setup/initial login felt like a lot of steps – had to set
up through webpage, click on the extension, go back to webpage to register,
wait for an email, then go back and log in through the extension. It was pretty
quick and easy but I could see getting sidetracked particularly waiting for the
email (mine did go to spam so if I wasn't dedicated to finding it I may have
abandoned through this process).","Prospect: ""I would see myself using this"" - as long as we cover more shopping sites. She can think of a number of use cases and suggests inviting others to be able to access your dashboard to pick a gift to give you on a special occassion.

Decent online shopper, Keeps open tabs and lots of amazon wishlists for all types of items - from school and home supplies to medieval-style swordsOne-stop-shop makes sense cause he shops for so many things that he cannot see how he would use a different tool for each.

Thinks it should deliver something Amazon wishlists do not - e.g. combining non-Amazon sites.

Always looking up musical instruments (owns a guitar and a set of drums, plus accessories), not usually finalizing those purchases online. ROPO (which is a form of deferred purchase)He does write down (on a paper notebook) instruments he digs. Not happy about his method - it’s messy and does not scaleDoesn’t see himself as online shopper - so the notion of “e-commerce assistant” does not resonate. Yet shortlisting and comparing musical instruments is something he feels a need forReckons this is a shortlisting tool, and anyways music sites are very specialized in the first place, so he doesn’t see an opportunity in becoming a marketplace or even a research site.

No regular pattern. Sometimes knows what he “needs” and goes for it. Sometimes he just researches in different stints and purchase comes way later. Frequently shopping online for tennis rackets (Amazon, sports vertical sites), and a lot of assorted supplies on AmazonDoesn’t keep formal lists of bookmarks to products. He does feel he is concerned with keeping product pages open as tabs to review them later. Only closes a tab when he knows he does not want the product.Thinks it could get confusing if not very well laid out. How can he see so many different items in a single place?

That was good insight, but not really what we were looking for. Anyways, he thought Breadcrumbs was a visualization tool.

So, there is lot of emailing, researching, and shared platforms he uses. As someone in our primary target market, he liked mockup 1. He liked how it was visual and focused on images over lists.

He likes how clean the thumbnail-text formatting is. he feels like in mockup 1 the text over the image is going to look very busy. Baljit also doesn't understand how to filter down if there are more than 10-15 articles to sort from. he was wondering if he can have a timeline scroll bar to scroll to a different month or so.

Also the same for when she was looking to dine out ni Doha - the all in one place element got her excited. She feels that the layout has an edge over usual Chrome browser history - and that about it - it is not different that browser history in any other way. She feels that the product is not going to be unique because all that is different in it is the way it categorizes content, and nothing really else.She kind of likes the second mockup because it is so clean and clear - the text and the image.

2015-02-18,Video Chat with Gerald Bäck,"Gerald is the founder of Archify, a discontinued browser history search engine. It initially started off with a value proposition to find stuff that users have seen before. The browser extension saves screenshots and archives full page articles for users to search from. They later integrated facebook and twitter timeline searches. They integrated Archify with Google search and Gmail so users can search for past content from google and email without going to Archify (the reason behind it is explained in mistake section item no.2)Mistakes:- Gerald pointed out that they sensed a lot of excitement about the idea but very few people were using the product. Even though the tool is straightforward, users just never thought about using it. Later Archify pivoted to Blippex, a private search engine that base priority on the amount of time other users spend on each page. The underlying assumption is that if the page is more important, people will spend more time on it.&nbsp;- Archify in its early days considered auto categorizing, but did not see much demand for it and decided not to pursue because it would only make it complicated.&nbsp;Instead, the tool also had fav/star function but was not used often either. This prompts us to rethink functionalities needed in our product. Even though we can think of a dozen additional features, chances are people will not use them if they couldn't see value in the main functionality.Insights:- Gerald said they used very traditional stemming mechanism, and they tried to extract only the articles (which I assume title + body text, no header/footer and text irrelevant to the main article).- About categorizing user content, he said it's going to be a challenge. Many times, an article is often 70% one topic and 30% another. How to make customized category meaningful to a specific user is something we need to be thinking about (which we have been thinking about, too).- Good marketing and design people are really important to a product like this.&nbsp;Gerald is willing to talk to us in the near future&nbsp;via skype or email&nbsp;to see how breadcrumbs turns out to be.&nbsp;",Archify cofounder described the trajectory of the product (kind of similar to what we are trying to do). He explained some key weaknesses of their product that eventually led to its discontinuation and also expressed interest in our approach and would like to give us feedback in the future too.,Mentor Engagement,,B) Getting access to ALL product pages previously browsed from a single place (a shopping list or shopping companion); C) Seeing a  category-based arrangement of product pages browsed

2015-02-06,"In Person Meeting with Kenny, MBA student, Kellogg","
Kenny has been compiling materials for the last 3 days or so on the following topic: telemedicine industry&nbsp;landscape in the USHe has been keeping around 10 tabs open on a permanent basis for this purpose, though he also used OneTab as a bookmarking solution, and Evernote as both a clipping tool and to create a list of the items he has to make sure to reviewNow he is going through the content he's been tracking down for these days. He starts from an Evernote list. He says this contains everything he's been looking at. He's still keeping some tabs open that he still hadn't had the time to review and decide whether to keep or notThe items are somewhat overlapping. E.g. there's a PPT he downloaded that contains many of the items he clippedKenny goes one by one through his list of clipped articles, trying to make out based on the URL what the article was about - discarding those he already saw in this other PPTAs he revisits articles, he's creating more and more tabsSometimes closes a tab because he thinks he doesn't need it anymore, and then has to do some workaround to open it back - e.g. loses a gartner tab. He knows it was gartner, and has all 5 gartner items shortlisted. Yet he doesn't know which of the 5 is the one - he starts typing in the nav bar the start of the url: gartner.com, and then /document because he still has in another tab a sibling item of the same type that gives him hints as to the URL formation. When he types in enough characters, the nav bar suggessts him the page he was looking for - he recognizes it by its Title.&nbsp;Whenever he discards some item, he deletes from Evernote and closes any corresponding tabs with the contentHe finds many articles require re-login, but he does not have a personal user - is under his school's institutional account covering all students. He needs to keep a separate tab with his school's resource list to be able to re-login to any of the information sources he's now revisitingHe finally opens a PPT and starts pulling content from the sources finally remaining on the shortlist. Once again, he has to go through every article on the list, for which he first tries to understand from the link what the item is about to see if he can cut some corners","BOOKMARKING IS NOT SHORTLISTING - Even after bookmarking relevant content, some users will still create a list either to ensure they know what to revisit later, or to sort the content by sub-topic. PHASE 1 IS BOOKMARKING, PHASE 2 IS SHORTLISTING, PHASE 3 IS REVISITING/FILTERING, PHASE 4 IS ACTUALLY TAKING CONTENT, (OPTIONAL - PHASE 5 IS QUOTING)
Revisiting content many a time requires re-logging in, which is a nuisance. Even worse, in academic institution environments customers usually log in through their institution's subscription, requiring a specific link with unfathomable auth parameters in it. In practice, this implies 1)Opening a new tab 2)Navigating tok to the school's ""Resource list"" page 3)Looking up the desired resource on the list 4)Logging in through the school's unique auth system (SSO) 5)Being redirected to the desired resource as an authorized user and 6)RELOADING the desired tab (the one for the item originally bookmarked/clipped).

Once bookmark/clippings have been done, it's still non-trivial to make out which one belongs to which item previously seen -> This supports the idea of a readable dashboard that guarantees first-sight content comprehension

She like the bigger circles. When you hover over the circles, she can see the individual pages and keywords in that article. She likes that. She wants to see the things on the circle, hovered over, a summary of sorts.- She also wants to see some kind of suggested articles. Like depending on the circles, she wants a section that said, based on the articles she has read, some suggestions of what other people read in this section.- Wrap up - She initially felt apprehensive of this product. But now she feels less suspicious. She would use this tool. Mostly for research - things in her life that she needs to know. Very useful not just for academia, like other things like voting for mayor (politics) - you are doing a detailed search, finding the right glasses, anything to do with comparing and contrasting.- She would love an annotation function, a share function, citation function.",She likes the visualization element.

When doing a search, starts with Google and bookmark important things occasionally if interesting. When doing serious research/project, uses Notes app on Mac or starts a Word doc and copy paste links and notes. Not a fan of bookmarking because the bookmark bar easily get congested. Uses Pocket on mobile, but seldom goes back to saved content. Claims an ideal situation would be a shortcut button that allows you to highlight a quote and grabs link and title and save it for immediate use when writing a report. Complaint: copy pasting as a work-around is not completely unnecessary, but dealing with different format and fonts is. Consistent categorization and organization is important to this user. If something can help identify which things she looked at for paper A and differentiate those info from paper B research, that would solve a lot of questions.
